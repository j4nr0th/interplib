Basis Sets
==========

Basis function sets of various types (Legendre, Lagrange, Bernstein),
their precomputation at integration nodes, the integration-independent endpoint
cache, the basis set registry, and the covector basis algebra used for
differential forms.

A basis set of *order* :math:`o` holds the :math:`o + 1` basis functions
of degree :math:`o` evaluated (together with their first derivatives) at the
nodes of an integration rule; the tensor products of these one-
dimensional sets span the :ref:`fdg_basis_functions` function spaces.  The
registry separately stores the two :math:`o + 1`-entry endpoint vectors for
each basis specification, since those values do not depend on the integration
rule.  The covector basis algebra encodes the wedge monomials
:math:`\mathrm{d} x_{i_1} \wedge \dots \wedge \mathrm{d} x_{i_k}` of the
:ref:`fdg_math_background` exterior algebra: each basis is a bit mask of
its indices together with a sign bit holding the permutation parity, and
the wedge product, Hodge star and ordering follow the sign conventions
described in :ref:`fdg_covector_basis`.
