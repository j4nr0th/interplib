class SingularLU:
    """Decomposition of a potentially singular matrix.

    The idea behind this process is that an LDU decomposition is performed,
    while if a zero is encountered on the pivot element, it is skipped. As
    such, it returns an "inverse", which will return a solution if it has
    no component in the null space of the matrix.

    The purpose of this function is to singular sub-blocks of matrices,
    which are then constrained by the use of Lagrange multipliers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mat : array_like
        Square array-like object, which represents the system matrix.
    rtol : float
        Relative tolerance at which the pivot is considered to be zero.
    atol : float
        Absolute tolerance at which the pivot is considered to be zero.
