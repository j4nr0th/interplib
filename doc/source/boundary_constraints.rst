Boundary Constraints
====================

A boundary constraint compares the trace of an element k-form with a test
k-form on one of its boundaries.  The public function
:func:`compute_kform_boundary_constraints` constructs the rows for one
selected element and one selected mesh boundary object.  The trace tables
reuse the integration-independent endpoint basis cache for the element axes
fixed on the boundary.  Trace assembly needs basis values (including the
lower-order values used by positive-form components), not basis derivatives;
there is therefore no separate derivative cache in this path.

Mathematical construction
-------------------------

Let :math:`\widehat{F}` be a canonical reference boundary and let
:math:`F_e` be its realization on element :math:`e`.  The selected mesh object
provides an orientation record that identifies the fixed element axes and maps
the free canonical axes to the element axes.  The element map is restricted to
that boundary by repeated calls to :meth:`SpaceMap.boundary`.

For a k-form, the restricted map supplies the tangential pullback.  If
:math:`u_e` is represented by element degrees of freedom and :math:`v` is a
test k-form on the boundary, a row of the constraint operator represents

.. math::

   (v, \operatorname{tr}_e u_e)_{F_e}
   = \int_{\widehat{F}}
     v \mathbin{\cdot} \operatorname{tr}_e u_e\,
     |\det J_{F_e}|\,d\widehat{x}.

The pullback is the identity for scalar forms.  For positive form order it
maps only tangential components and includes the usual k-form basis
transformation.  The surface measure is positive; orientation signs are kept
in the component mapping and in the canonical boundary parameterization.

For two adjacent elements, let :math:`T_A` and :math:`T_B` be the operators
returned for the same mesh boundary object.  Continuity can be enforced by
assembling

.. math::

   T_A u_A - T_B u_B = 0.

It can also be checked after a solution has been computed by applying the two
operators separately and comparing their row values.  The test space must be
the same on both calls.  The mesh topology supplies the relative orientation,
so the two calls do not need to use the same local ordering of the boundary
axes.

Packed operator format
----------------------

The function returns four one-dimensional arrays:

``row_offsets``
    An array of length ``n_rows + 1``.  Entries for row ``i`` occupy the half
    open range ``row_offsets[i]:row_offsets[i + 1]``.

``components``
    Element k-form component index for each packed entry.

``local_dofs``
    DoF index inside the corresponding element component.

``coefficients``
    Physical trace inner-product coefficient for the entry.

For flattened element values ``u`` the value of row ``i`` is therefore

.. math::

   r_i(u) = \sum_{j=row\_offsets_i}^{row\_offsets_{i+1}-1}
     coefficients_j\,u[components_j, local\_dofs_j].

CSR conversion
--------------

For global element-major rows, :func:`packed_kform_constraints_to_csr` converts
the packed representation to ``(data, indices, indptr)`` arrays accepted
directly by ``scipy.sparse.csr_matrix``.  The column indices include the
element offset and the flattened component offset, so callers do not need to
materialize row indices or perform per-entry index arithmetic in Python.


Boundary load
-------------

The companion function :func:`compute_kform_boundary_load` assembles the
*chain integral* of a :math:`k`-form datum against the trace of the element
:math:`(k-1)`-form on a codimension-1 boundary face, for every datum degree
:math:`k = 1, \dots, n` (the datum order is ``element_spec.order + 1``).  For
a face with fixed normal axis :math:`a` at side :math:`s` (``-1`` for the
start side, ``+1`` for the end side) and reference face quadrature points
:math:`\widehat{x}_p` with weights :math:`w_p`, the load entries are

.. math::

   b_j = s\,o\,(-1)^{|\{i \in J_e : i < a\}|}
     \sum_p w_p\, u_{J_e \cup \{a\}}(\Phi_{F_e}(\widehat{x}_p))\,
     B_j(\widehat{x}_p),

where :math:`J_e` is the set of element-frame axes of the traced component,
:math:`o` is the orientation sign of the mapped component, :math:`B_j` runs
over the element :math:`(k-1)`-form basis of that component and
:math:`\Phi_{F_e}` is the restricted element map.  Only the datum component
whose axes are :math:`J_e \cup \{a\}` pairs with the traced component; all
other components contribute nothing.  The datum is passed as one callable per
:math:`k`-form component in element-frame component order (the same order as
:class:`KFormSpecs` components); each callable receives the physical
coordinates of the canonical face points and returns one value per point.
When :math:`k = n` there is a single component and a single callable is
accepted directly.

At :math:`k = n` the traced component is the volume form component and the
exponent reduces to :math:`a`, so the sign becomes :math:`s\,(-1)^a`, the
outward boundary orientation relative to the canonical face parameterization,
and the formula reduces to the scalar chain integral of previous releases.
Zero-form data (:math:`k = 0`) is not covered by the load; scalar boundary
values are imposed strongly with :func:`compute_kform_boundary_constraints`.

Unlike the trace constraint, the load is a metric-free chain integral: the
surface measure of the face cancels exactly against the coefficient scaling of
the pulled-back form, so no surface weights or pullback tensor enter the
assembly.

In the mixed Poisson formulation the natural boundary term of the momentum
equation is

.. math::

   \int_{\partial\Omega} p \wedge \star u_D
   = \sum_{F_e \subset \partial\Omega} \int_{F_e} u_D\,(\operatorname{tr} p),

which applies the Dirichlet condition :math:`u = u_D` weakly: the load of one
face with :math:`\mathrm{data} = u_D` is added to the momentum (flux) block of
the right-hand side.  The gallery example
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_multi_element_poisson_bc.py` combines this
weak Dirichlet condition on some faces with the strong Neumann condition
:math:`\operatorname{tr} q = g` (enforced by Lagrange multipliers with
:func:`compute_kform_boundary_constraints`) on the remaining faces.

Topology and dimensions
-----------------------

``collections`` is a tuple containing object-boundary arrays from dimension
one through the element dimension.  For a three-dimensional element, for
example, it contains line, face, and volume collections.  A collection for
objects of dimension ``d`` has shape ``(count, 2*d)`` and stores the IDs of its
lower and upper boundaries in each local axis.

``boundary_id`` is an ID in the collection matching the test space dimension:
points use the implicit point collection, lines use the one-dimensional
collection, faces use the two-dimensional collection, and so on.  The selected
object must be immersed in ``element_id``.  The wrapper rejects incompatible
orders and dimensions, non-unique topology, or a boundary that is not present
in the selected element.

A zero-dimensional :class:`FunctionSpace` is the canonical test space for a
point boundary:

.. code-block:: python

   point_test = KFormSpecs(0, FunctionSpace())

Example
-------

The gallery example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_boundary_constraints.py`
constructs adjacent two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements.  It
prints the packed rows, materializes them with ``scipy.sparse``, and checks
polynomial traces on shared faces, lines, and points before plotting the
geometries.
