/**
 * Main test function to verify the numerical integration rule using the Gauss-Legendre method.
 *
 * This function iteratively tests the integration rule for different levels of accuracy.
 * For each accuracy level, it validates the computed integral of monomials against the analytical result.
 * The test ensures that the integration rule produces results close to the expected analytical values
 * within specified tolerances using the provided testing utilities.
 *
 * @return 0 if the program completes successfully.
