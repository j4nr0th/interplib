Multi-element mixed Poisson equation with strong and weak boundary conditions
=============================================================================

This example extends the multi-element mixed Poisson example by applying
boundary conditions on the outer boundary of the domain. The outer boundary is
*deformed*: the coordinate map no longer keeps the boundary fixed, so the
boundary faces are curved.

Two kinds of boundary conditions are demonstrated:

* a **strong** condition on the flux :math:`q`, enforced with Lagrange
  multipliers: the trace :math:`\operatorname{tr} q` on a face is prescribed
  by :meth:`Mesh.compute_kform_boundary_constraints`, exactly like the flux
  continuity between two elements;
* a **weak** condition on the solution :math:`u`, applied through the natural
  boundary term of the mixed formulation: the momentum equation is
  :math:`(p, q) + (\mathrm{d}p, u) = \int_{\partial\Omega} p \wedge \star u_D`,
  so prescribing :math:`u = u_D` weakly adds the boundary load
  :math:`\int_{F_e} u_D \operatorname{tr} p` to the momentum right-hand side.
  This is exactly the integral computed by :func:`compute_kform_boundary_load`.

The mixed Poisson equation is solved with the manufactured solution
:math:`u = \mathrm{SCALE}(\prod_i \cos(\pi x_i / 2) + 1)`, whose trace on the
deformed outer boundary is nonzero, with the flux
:math:`q = \star \mathrm{d}\star u` prescribed strongly on two faces and the
solution prescribed weakly on the remaining faces. Both a *neighboring* pair
of strong faces and an *opposite* pair are shown in two dimensions; because
the strong condition acts on the flux, neighboring strong faces constrain
disjoint components and do not over-constrain the system.
