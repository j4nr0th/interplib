/**

 * The API describes a k-form test space on a canonical interface and one or

 * pairings, physical-space pairings, and boundary loads into packed sparse
 * rows. All pointers supplied by the caller are borrowed; this module never
 * allocates or frees caller-owned storage.
 *
 * Dimensions and component indices use the canonical axis order expected by

 * outputs and output counts are committed only after their checks succeed;
 * assembly buffers may be partially populated only where a function documents
 * that behavior.
